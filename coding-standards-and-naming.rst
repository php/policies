 Coding Standards and Naming Policy
####################################

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in `BCP 14
<https://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp14.txt>`_ [`RFC2119
<https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119>`_] [`RFC8174
<https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8174>`_] when, and only when, they
appear in all capitals, as shown here.

This policy lists standards that any programmer adding or changing code in PHP
should follow.

**************
 Symbol Names
**************

Acronyms
========

Abbreviations and acronyms as well as initialisms SHOULD be avoided wherever
possible.

Abbreviations, acronyms, and initialisms MUST be treated like regular words,
thus they should be written with an uppercase first character, followed by
lowercase characters.

Diverging from this policy is NOT RECOMMENDED, but it is allowed to keep
internal consistency within a single extension, if the name follows an
established, language-agnostic standard, or for other reasons, if those reasons
are properly justified and voted on as part of the RFC process.

Functions
=========

Function names MUST be in lowercase, with words underscore delimited, with care
taken to minimize the letter count.

Good function names:

-  ``str_word_count``
-  ``array_key_exists``

Bad function names:

-  ``hw_GetObjectByQueryCollObj``
-  ``pg_setclientencoding``
-  ``jf_n_s_i``

If functions are part of a "parent set" of functions, that parent MUST be
included in the user function name, and should be clearly related to the parent
program or function family. This should be in the form of ``parent_*``:

A family of ``foo`` functions, for example:

Good names:

-  ``foo_select_bar``
-  ``foo_insert_baz``
-  ``foo_delete_baz``

Bad names:

-  ``fooselect_bar``
-  ``fooinsertbaz``
-  ``delete_foo_baz``

Methods
=======

Method names SHOULD follow the studlyCaps (also referred to as bumpy case or
camel caps) naming convention, with care taken to minimize the letter count. The
initial letter of the name is lowercase, and each letter that starts a new word
is capitalized.

Good method names:

-  ``connect()``
-  ``getData()``
-  ``buildSomeWidget()``
-  ``performHttpRequest()``

Bad method names:

-  ``get_Data()``
-  ``buildsomewidget()``
-  ``getI()``
-  ``performHTTPRequest()``

Classes
=======

Existing user-level class names are NOT RECOMMENDED to be changed. Although it
would be possible (class names are case-insensitive).

New class names MUST be descriptive nouns in PascalCase and as short as
possible. Each word in the class name MUST start with a capital letter, without
underscore delimiters. The class name MUST be prefixed with the name of the
"parent set" (e.g. the name of the extension) if no namespaces are used.

Good class names:

-  ``Curl``
-  ``CurlResponse``
-  ``HttpStatusCode``
-  ``Url``
-  ``BtreeMap`` (B-tree Map)
-  ``UserId`` (User Identifier)
-  ``Char`` (Character)
-  ``Intl`` (Internationalization)
-  ``Ssl\Certificate``
-  ``Ssl\Crl`` (Certificate Revocation List)
-  ``Ssl\CrlUrl``

Bad class names:

-  ``curl``
-  ``curl_response``
-  ``HTTPStatusCode``
-  ``URL``
-  ``BTreeMap``
-  ``UserID`` (User Identifier)
-  ``CHAR``
-  ``INTL``
-  ``SSL\Certificate``
-  ``SSL\CRL``
-  ``SSL\CRLURL``

PHP Extension Classification
============================

All symbols (classes, functions, constants) provided by PHP are part of an
extension. Extensions can be classified into three categories:

-  Required extensions (including ``Core`` and ``standard``). These extensions
   are always present, and PHP cannot be built without them.

-  Bundled extensions (including ``ctype`` and ``mbstring``). These extensions
   are part of the php-src distribution, but PHP can be built without them.
   Bundled extensions can be either enabled or disabled by default.

-  3rd-party extensions (including ``apcu`` and ``igbinary``). These extensions
   are not part of the php-src distribution, and either available through PECL,
   or on GitHub.

Extensions may move between these three categories over time. ``hash`` and
``json`` moved from "bundled" to "required", in PHP 7.4 and 8.0 respectively.
``sodium`` and ``ffi`` moved from 3rd-party to bundled. ``xmlrpc`` and ``wddx``
moved from bundled to 3rd-party.

Core, Standard, Spl
===================

Symbols MUST NOT be namespaced under the ``Core``, ``Standard`` or ``Spl``
namespaces. Instead, these extensions should be considered as a collection of
different components (``str_*``, ``password_*``), and SHOULD be namespaced
according to these component names.

If a component gets introduced it MAY use a namespace. For example, if a new
component ``vector`` is introduced, it MUST consist of functions all starting
with ``vector_*`` (such as ``vector_multiply()``), OR they MUST all be
namespaced functions under the ``Vector`` namespace, such as
``Vector\multiply()``.

Bundled Extensions
==================

Bundled PHP extensions SHOULD use namespaces, subject to the guidelines laid out
in the following:

-  Extensions MUST NOT use a vendor namespace.
-  The top-level namespace MUST match the extension name (apart from casing).
-  Namespace names MUST follow ``CamelCase``.
-  All symbols defined in the extension SHOULD be part of the extension's
   top-level namespace or a sub-namespace.

This policy allows the use of namespaces, and provides basic guidelines for
their use. It does not propose to migrate already existing non-namespaced
symbols to use namespaces.

Examples
--------

If we were to introduce ``openssl`` as a new namespaced extension, here is how
the symbol names could change in line with these guidelines:

-  ``OpenSSLCertificate`` becomes ``OpenSSL\Certificate``
-  ``openssl_dh_compute_key()`` becomes ``OpenSSL\dh_compute_key()``
-  ``X509_PURPOSE_SSL_CLIENT`` becomes ``OpenSSL\X509_PURPOSE_SSL_CLIENT``

The above guidelines recommend against the global ``FFI`` class used by the
``ffi`` extension. Using ``FFI\FFI`` would be preferred.

Existing Non-Namespaced Symbols and Consistency
===============================================

When adding new symbols to existing extensions it is RECOMMENDED to be
consistent with existing symbols, rather than to follow the namespacing
guidelines.

For example, the ``array_is_list()`` function added in PHP 8.1 MUST indeed be
called ``array_is_list()`` and MUST NOT have been introduced as
``Array\is_list()`` or similar. Unless and until existing ``array_*()``
functions are aliased under an ``Array\*`` namespace, new additions MUST
continue to be of the form ``array_*()`` to maintain horizontal consistency.

This is a somewhat loose guideline, and applies more strongly to functions than
classes. In particular, when new object-oriented elements are introduced into an
extension that has historically been procedural, these MAY be namespaced. For
example, if ``OpenSSLCertificate`` had only been introduced in PHP 8.1, it could
have been named ``OpenSSL\Certificate``.

For the Core, Standard, and Spl extensions, the previous considerations on
component subdivision apply. The fact that string and array functions are not
namespaced does not preclude new namespaced components in these extensions.

Namespace Collisions
====================

As a matter of courtesy, top-level namespaces used by extensions SHOULD avoid
collisions with existing, commonly used open-source libraries or extensions (or
happen with the agreement of the parties involved). This document does not try
to provide a hard guideline on what constitutes a sufficiently important
library. The application of common sense is recommended.

Throwables
==========

Newly introduced extensions MUST follow the following rules, existing extensions
SHOULD follow the rules for newly introduced exceptions, but MAY diverge for
consistency with existing symbols.

In the interest of readability the following text uses the word "exception" to
refer to any kind of ``Throwable``. ``Exception`` in code blocks refers to the
``\Exception`` class.

The class name of an exception MUST end in ``Exception`` (when extending from
the ``Exception`` hierarchy) or ``Error`` (for the ``Error`` hierarchy).
Exceptions MUST NOT be ``final``.

Extensions MUST have their own hierarchy of exceptions. At the lowest level of
the hierarchy there MUST be a base ``Exception`` and base ``Error`` defined
within the top-level of the extension's namespace. The unqualified class name of
the base exceptions must be the name of the extension followed by ``Exception``
or ``Error``. These base exceptions MUST directly extend from the global base
``\Exception`` or ``\Error`` classes. The extension's base ``Error`` MAY be
omitted if it is unused.

As an example, an extension called ``Example`` would define the following base
exceptions:

.. code::

   namespace Example;

   class ExampleException extends \Exception { }
   class ExampleError extends \Error { }

An extension SHOULD define additional exceptions as appropriate to allow users
to catch specific classes of exception for granular error handling. Any
additional exception MUST either extend the extension's base exception or
another exception defined by the extension. The unqualified class name of
additional exceptions SHOULD be sufficiently specific to make collisions with
the unqualified class name of other exceptions unlikely. The name of the
extension SHOULD NOT be used within the unqualified class name of additional
exceptions if the only purpose is to make the class name more unique.
Specifically, the name of the extension SHOULD NOT be a simple prefix or suffix
of the unqualified class name.

As an example, an additional exception for failing HTTP requests of the curl
extension might be called ``Curl\FailedHttpRequestException``. This is
sufficiently specific to avoid collisions, since using two different HTTP
clients in a single source file is unlikely. It should not use
``Curl\CurlFailedHttpRequestException``,
``Curl\FailedCurlHttpRequestException``,
``Curl\FailedHttpRequestCurlException``, or similar. A file extension however
might want to define a ``File\FileNotFoundException`` and a
``File\DirectoryNotFoundException``. In this case the name of the extension is a
generic term and the ``File`` prefix in ``FileNotFoundException`` adds useful
context to differentiate it from the ``DirectoryNotFoundException``.

An extension MUST NOT throw exceptions that it did not define itself, except for
the global ``TypeError`` or ``ValueError`` exceptions thrown during parameter
parsing and parameter validation, and (subclasses of) exceptions that are
already defined to be thrown by a class that is subclassed itself. If an
extension uses external functionality that may throw an exception it MUST wrap
any exception thrown by that functionality into an appropriate exception of its
own. It MUST set the ``$previous`` property to the original exception when doing
so.

As an example, an extension that uses the CSPRNG must wrap the
``Random\RandomException`` thrown on CSPRNG failure into an appropriate
extension-specific exception.

The ``Error`` hierarchy MUST NOT be used for errors that are expected to be
thrown (and caught) during normal operation of a PHP program.

As an example, a parsing function that is expected to be used with untrusted
input must not throw an ``Error`` if the input is malformed. Similarly a
function that interacts with the network must not throw an ``Error`` if the
network operation fails. Any ``Error`` that is thrown should usually result in a
reasonably obvious fix in the PHP program.

All exceptions MUST have a descriptive exception message intended for human
consumption. Non-base exceptions MAY define additional properties to provide
additional metadata about the nature of the error.

The exception message MUST NOT be the only means of distinguishing exception
causes that the user might want to handle differently. Any two exceptions with
different causes MUST be identifiable either by a unique exception class name, a
stable ``$code``, or a class-specific additional property suitable for
programmatic consumption (e.g. an enum).

As an example, in an HTTP client a connection failure due to a timeout is
considered to be a different cause than a connection failure due to a
non-existent hostname, as the user might want to schedule a retry when the
connection times out, but not for unknown hostnames. If using the same
``ConnectionFailureException`` class name for both errors, they must provide a
property suitable for programmatic consumption and may not just differ in their
exception message.

************************
 Implementation Details
************************

#. Document your code in source files and the manual. (tm)

#. PHP is implemented in C11.

   For instance, the optional fixed-width integers from ``stdint.h``
   (``int8_t``, ``int16_t``, ``int32_t``, ``int64_t`` and their unsigned
   counterparts) are supposed to be available.

#. Functions that are given pointers to resources SHOULD NOT free them, unless
   this is documented.

   For instance, ``function int mail(char *to, char *from)`` should NOT free
   ``to`` and/or ``from``.

   Exceptions:

   -  The function's designated behavior is freeing that resource. E.g.
      ``efree()``.

   -  The function is given a boolean argument, that controls whether or not the
      function may free its arguments (if ``true``, the function must free its
      arguments; if ``false``, it must not).

   -  Low-level parser routines, that are tightly integrated with the token
      cache and the bison code for minimum memory copying overhead.

#. Functions that are tightly integrated with other functions within the same
   module, and rely on each other's non-trivial behavior, MUST be documented as
   such and declared ``static``.

#. You SHOULD use definitions and macros whenever possible, so that constants
   have meaningful names and can be easily manipulated. Any use of a numeric
   constant to specify different behavior or actions SHOULD be done through a
   ``#define``.

#. When writing functions that deal with strings, you SHOULD use
   ``zend_string``, which holds the value and the length property of each
   string.

   Write your functions in such a way so that they'll take advantage of the
   length property by using ``ZSTR_LEN()``, both for efficiency, and in order
   for them to be binary-safe.

#. You SHOULD use the ``smart_str_*`` family of functions for string creation,
   instead of relying on the C-library versions, such as ``strncat()``.

#. You SHOULD use ``PHP_*`` macros in the PHP source, and ``ZEND_*`` macros in
   the Zend part of the source. Although the ``PHP_*`` macros are mostly aliased
   to the ``ZEND_*`` macros it gives a better understanding on what kind of
   macro you're calling.

#. You MUST NOT define functions that are not available. For instance, if a
   library is missing a function, do not define the PHP version of the function,
   and do not raise a run-time error about the function not existing. End users
   should use ``function_exists()`` to test for the existence of a function.

#. You SHOULD use ``emalloc()``, ``efree()``, ``estrdup()``, instead of their
   standard C library counterparts. These functions implement an internal
   "safety-net" mechanism that ensures the deallocation of any unfreed memory at
   the end of a request. They also provide useful allocation and overflow
   information while running in debug mode.

   In almost all cases, memory returned to the engine must be allocated using
   ``emalloc()``.

   The use of ``malloc()`` SHOULD be limited to cases where a third-party
   library may need to control or free the memory, or when the memory in
   question needs to survive between multiple requests.

#. The return type of "is" or "has" style functions SHOULD be ``bool`` which
   return a "yes"/"no" answer. `zend_result` is an appropriate return value for
   functions that perform some operation that may succeed or fail.

Variable Names
==============

Variable names MUST be meaningful. One letter variable names SHOULD be avoided,
except for places where the variable has no real meaning or a trivial meaning
(e.g. ``for (i=0; i<100; i++) ...``).

Variable names MUST be in lowercase. Use underscores to separate between words.

Internal Function Naming Conventions
====================================

The main module source file MUST be named ``modulename.c``.

Header files that are used by other sources must be named ``php_modulename.h``.

Functions that are part of the external API MUST be named
``php_modulename_function()`` to avoid symbol collision. They MUST be in
lowercase, with words underscore delimited. Exposed API MUST be defined in
``php_modulename.h``:

.. code::

   PHPAPI char *php_session_create_id(PS_CREATE_SID_ARGS);

Unexposed module function MUST be ``static`` and MUST NOT be defined in
`php_modulename.h`:

.. code::

   static int php_session_destroy()

Syntax and indentation
======================

You SHOULD Use K&R-style. When you write code that goes into the core of PHP or
one of its standard modules, please maintain the K&R style.

Be generous with whitespace and braces. Keep one empty line between the variable
declaration section and the statements in a block, as well as between logical
statement groups in a block. Maintain at least one empty line between two
functions. Always prefer:

.. code::

   if (foo) {
       bar;
   }

to:

.. code::

   if(foo)bar;

You MUST use the tab character when indenting. A tab is expected to represent
four spaces. It is important to maintain consistency in indentation so that
definitions, comments, and control structures line up correctly.

Preprocessor statements (``#if`` and such) MUST start at column one. To indent
preprocessor directives you should put the ``#`` at the beginning of a line,
followed by any number of spaces.

The length of constant string literals SHOULD be calculated via ``strlen()``
instead of using ``sizeof()-1`` as it is clearer and any modern compiler will
optimize it away. Legacy usages of the latter style exists within the codebase
but SHOULD NOT be refactored, unless larger refactoring around that code is
taking place.

Testing
=======

Extensions SHOULD be well tested using ``*.phpt`` tests. Read more at
`qa.php.net documentation <https://qa.php.net/write-test.php>`_.

Experimental Functions
======================

New extensions MUST start out as third-party extensions, or in an experimental
branch, until an RFC is passed to add them to the core distribution.

Aliases & Legacy Documentation
==============================

You may also have some deprecated aliases with close to duplicate names, for
example, ``somedb_select_result`` and ``somedb_selectresult``. For documentation
purposes, these will only be documented by the most current name, with the
aliases listed in the documentation for the parent function. For ease of
reference, user-functions with completely different names, that alias to the
same function (such as ``highlight_file`` and ``show_source``), will be
separately documented.

Backwards compatible functions and names SHOULD be maintained as long as the
code can be reasonably be kept as part of the codebase. See the `README in the
PHP documentation repository
<https://github.com/php/doc-base/blob/master/README.md>`_ for more information
on documentation.
