This document outlines the release cycles of the PHP language.

***************
 Release Cycle
***************

Roughly:

-  Yearly release cycle

-  4 years release life cycle

   -  2 years bug fixes only
   -  2 years security fixes only

No feature addition after final x.y.0 release (or x.0.0).

Backward compatibility MUST be respected within the same major release (e.g.,
8.x.x). Binary compatibility (API or ABI) MAY be broken between two features
releases, f.e. between 8.3 and 8.4.

Major Version Number
====================

-  x.y.z to x+1.0.0

   -  Bug fixes
   -  New features
   -  Extensions support can be ended (moved to PECL)
   -  Backward compatibility can be broken
   -  API compatibility can be broken (internals and userland)
   -  ABI can be broken (internals)

Minor Version Number
====================

-  x.y.z to x.y+1.z

   -  Bugfixes
   -  New features
   -  Extensions support can be ended (moved to PECL)
   -  Backward compatibility must be kept
   -  API compatibility must be kept (userland)
   -  ABI and API can be broken (internals)
   -  Source compatibility should be kept if possible, while breakages are
      allowed

Patch Version Number
====================

-  x.y.z to x.y.z+1

   -  Bug fixes and security patches only
   -  Extensions support can't be removed (like move them to PECL)
   -  Backward compatibility must be kept (internals and userland)
   -  ABI and API compatibility must be kept (internals)

It is critical to understand the consequences of breaking BC, APIs or ABIs (only
internals related). It should not be done for the sake of doing it. RFCs
explaining the reasoning behind a breakage and the consequences along with test
cases and patch(es) should help.

See the following links for explanation about API and ABI:

-  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface
-  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface

 Release Timeline
******************

The process starts the first Tuesday of July of each year, and nominally runs
for 20 weeks. With 3 alpha releases, 3 beta releases, 4 release candidates, and
a GA (x.0.0) release.

Examples are given for 2024 and PHP 8.4. Releases are tagged on the Tuesday of
each week, with a release before Thursday 24:00 (UTC).

In the examples, `$rd` describes the release day of the first alpha release.

Alpha Releases
==============

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 0
   :stub-columns: 1

   -  -  Alpha 1
      -  -  Tag on *First Tuesday of July*: ``$rd - 2`` (Jul 2, 2024)
         -  Release before *First Thursday of July*: ``$rd`` (Jul 4, 2024)

   -  -  Alpha 2
      -  ``$rd + 14`` (Jul 18, 2024)

   -  -  Alpha 3
      -  ``$rd + 28`` (Aug 01, 2024)

During the alpha releases:

-  New features may be added at will, following the normal RFC procedures.

Beta Releases
=============

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 0
   :stub-columns: 1

   -  -  Beta 1
      -  -  Tag / Feature Freeze: ``$rd + 40`` (Aug 13, 2024)
         -  Release: ``$rd + 42`` (Aug 15, 2024)

   -  -  Beta 2
      -  ``$rd + 56`` (Aug 29, 2024)

   -  -  Beta 3
      -  ``$rd + 70`` (Sep 12, 2024)

At feature freeze:

-  All features requiring an RFC must have passed by the voting mechanism, and
   SHOULD be merged prior to feature freeze.

After feature freeze, with blessing of the release managers:

-  Merging features that do require an RFC is still allowed.
-  Features that do not require an RFC are still allowed.
-  Optimisations and internal ABI and API changes are also still allowed.

Release Candidates
==================

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 0
   :stub-columns: 1

   -  -  Release Candidate 1
      -  -  Tag: ``$rd + 82`` (Sep 24, 2024)
         -  Release: ``$rd + 84`` (Sep 26, 2024)

   -  -  Release Candidate 2
      -  ``$rd + 98`` (Oct 10, 2024)

   -  -  Release Candidate 3
      -  ``$rd + 112`` (Oct 24, 2024)

   -  -  Release Candidate 4
      -  ``$rd + 126`` (Nov 07, 2024)

More release candidates MAY be added on a two-week cycle, if necessary.

With the first release candidate:

-  Internal API numbers MUST be updated (``PHP_API_VERSION``,
   ``ZEND_MODULE_API_NO``, and ``ZEND_EXTENSION_API_NO``).
-  The release branch (``PHP-8.4``) MUST be created.

After the first release candidate:

-  There MUST NOT be any API and ABI changes in subsequent RCs.
-  There MUST NOT be any new features, small or otherwise, in subsequent RCs.

General Availability
====================

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 0
   :stub-columns: 1

   -  -  x.y.0 (8.4.0)
      -  -  Tag: ``$rd + 138`` (Nov 19, 2024)
         -  Release: ``$rd + 140`` (Nov 21, 2024)

The GA release MUST be released from the last Release Candidate tag (RC4 or
later). There MUST NOT be any changes between the last Release Candidate tag and
the GA tag (with exception to files such as `NEWS` and other files where the PHP
version number must change for the GA release).

Bug Fix and Security Releases
=============================

After the general availability release:

-  Until the end of year 2 (e.g., for PHP 8.4: until Dec 31, 2026):

      -  A new release every 4 weeks, synchronised with other release branches.
      -  Bug fixes and security fixes.

-  Until the end of year 3 (e.g., for PHP 8.4: until Dec 31, 2027):

      -  Security fixes, and fixes to address regressions introduced during a
         normal bug fix release.

      -  Updates to ABI incompatible versions of dependent libraries on Windows.

      -  Release only when there is a security issue or regression issue to
         address.

      -  Security fix and regression releases SHOULD occur on the same date as
         bug fix releases for the other branches. Exceptions can be made for
         high risk security issues or high profile regressions.

-  Until the end of year 4 (e.g., for PHP 8.4: until Dec 31, 2028):

      -  Security fixes **only**.

      -  Release only when there is a security issue.

      -  Security fix releases SHOULD occur on the same date as bug fix releases
         for the other branches. Exceptions can be made for high risk security
         issues.

      -  Updates to ABI incompatible versions of dependent libraries on Windows
         are **not** performed.

*"End of year" means:* The end of the calendar year, i.e., Dec 31 at 24:00 UTC.
The numbered years in the examples (e.g., "end of year 2") indicate the number
of calendar years following the *original planned GA release date*. For example,
if the planned GA release date for PHP 8.4 is Nov 21, 2024, then "end of year 2"
is Dec 31, 2026, 24:00 UTC, even if the actual release date slips to Jan 9,
2025.

***********************************
 Feature selection and development
***********************************

RFCs have been introduced many years ago and have been proven as being an
amazing way to avoid conflicts while providing a very good way to propose new
things to php.net. New features or additions to the core should go through the
RFC process. It has been done successfully (as the process went well, but the
features were not necessary accepted) already for a dozen of new features or
improvements.

Features can use branch(es) if necessary, doing so will minimize the impact of
other commits and changes on the development of a specific feature (or the other
way 'round). The shorter release cycle also ensures that a given feature can get
into the next release, as long as the RFC has been accepted.

The change to what we have now is the voting process. It will not happen anymore
on the mailing list but in the RFCs directly, for php.net members, in a public
way.

See also `the voting RFC <https://wiki.php.net/rfc/voting>`_.

The question for this section is about who will be allowed to vote:

-  php-src (yes, no)
-  php-doc (yes, no)
-  qa, phpt (yes, no)
-  other sub projects like pear (yes, no)

We have voting plugin for dokuwiki (doodle2) that allows voting on the wiki
(installed).

**********
 RMs Role
**********

The roles of the release managers are about being a facilitator:

-  Manage the release process
-  Start the decisions discussions and vote about the features and change for a
   given release
-  Create a roadmap and planing according to this RFC
-  Package the releases (test and final releases)
-  Decide which bug fixes can be applied to a release, within the cases defined
   in this RFC

But they are not:

-  Decide which features, extension or SAPI get in a release or not

Discussions or requests for a feature or to apply a given patch must be done on
the public internals mailing list or in the security mailing (ideally using the
bug tracker)

****************************
 Release managers selection
****************************

About three months prior to the scheduled release of the first alpha release of
the next minor or major version (around April 1st or shortly thereafter), the
release managers for the latest version branch should issue a call for
volunteers to begin the selection process for the next release managers.

The release manager team consists of two or three people, it is notable that at
least one of the volunteers should be a "veteran" release manager, meaning they
have contributed to at least one PHP release in the past. The other can be an
additional veteran or, ideally, someone new to the RM role (to increase number
of veteran RMs).

Issue the call for volunteers on internals@lists.php.net on or around March 1st.
See, for example: https://news-web.php.net/php.internals/113334

There is no rule for how long the call for volunteers must remain open. We
should aim to select the release managers by early April, so announcing the call
in early March gives people about a month to decide whether they wish to
volunteer.

Voting is conducted using "Single Transferrable Vote" (STV).

Using some maths, we'll start with the 1st preference and gradually remove
candidates with the fewest votes, transferring votes that had previously gone to
them to their voter’s 2nd preference, and so on. Once required number of
candidates have a quorum (Droop quota), those will be officially selected as our
RMs.

***************************************************************
 Feature(s) preview release, solving the experimental features
***************************************************************

Some features require a lot of testing or users feedback before they can be
considered as ready, stable enough, or proven as having made good design
decisions. Having them in normal releases is dangerous. The past releases told
us more than once that many good ideas ended as being not so good after all. But
we had to keep them in and, even worst, maintain them forever.

A feature preview release could solve this problem. A feature(s) preview release
gives us and our users a way to try bleeding edge additions to the language or
core while providing us with an invaluable feedback to actually valid both the
implementation and the design choices.

Non core features (engine, stream, etc.) could benefit from a feature preview
release while doing it via PECL should be the preferred way.

Feature(s) preview releases can happen any time and can be platform specific.
Whether a specific development branch is used or not is up to the developers of
the given features (external repositories like github or bitbucket can obviously
be used as well).

*********************
 Security Management
*********************

-  Each security flaw must have a CVE id before the final release.

-  Ideally security issues and their fixes are reported and discussed in the
   issues tracker

   -  Needs a 'security' flag in bugs.php.net (implemented, a CVE field has been
      added as well)
   -  Methods to reproduce a flaw may remain non public (on a case by case
      basis)
   -  Be sure that the security team of each major distributions have access to
      the security reports, before public release
